/// only for a layer whose object authors `visible`, as WE 2.8.42 plays them: §5.19):
/// 1. A path finished since the last frame (a "single" clock) is rewound and a new one picked; so
///    is one when none plays yet. `queuemode` "sequential" takes the next visible path, wrapping;
///    "random" draws from a bag of the visible paths at a uniform index, steps past entries equal
///    to the path it drew last, and removes what it drew; an empty bag is refilled with each
///    visible path once. The first bag is the one the path file's load leaves, which holds most
///    paths twice (`loadedBag`). The generator is seeded per load, so the order differs every
///    time, as in WE (docs/test-risks.md MG1).
/// 2. The path's clock advances (the timeline clock, `SceneTimelineClock`) and its channels are
///    sampled between whole frames. A component without keyframes follows the layer's world
///    matrix: eye = its translation, centre = eye − 5·normalize(row 2), up = normalize(row 1).
/// 3. The result is written back into the layer: `origin` = eye and `angles` those of
///    `lookAt(eye, centre, up)`, so the camera moves through its own transform. A perspective
///    scene takes the path's `fov` channel (50 without one); `zoom` is an orthographic scene's.
///    The write-back wins over a script's or a timeline's `origin` and `angles` on the layer: WE
///    2.8.42 follows only the path while one plays, and the script only without one (§5.20).
