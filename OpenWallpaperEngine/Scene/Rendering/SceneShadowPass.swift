///
/// - The atlas is cleared to 0 once, then the maps are drawn in batches of views: each point
///   light's six faces as one batch, then the spots and cascades six at a time, in the layout's
///   order (points first).
/// - A batch sets one viewport per view and draws every caster instanced once per view: the
///   material's shadow variant (`ModelMaterialPlan.shadowCaster`, `shadowcaster.vert`) takes
///   `g_ViewportViewProjectionMatrices[gl_InstanceID]` and writes the viewport index.
/// - Casters are the visible model objects with `castshadow` (models default to true) that are
///   opaque (a mesh blending normal or alpha-to-coverage), and of those only their opaque meshes;
///   one is skipped when its box's sphere lies outside every view of the batch.
/// - The state is WE's biased raster state: slope-scaled depth bias −4, no constant bias or clamp,
///   and, by WE's quirk (the biased back-cull state was made with culling off), no culling;
///   `shadowcaster.json`'s depth test and write, reversed (GREATER).
/// - A frame whose commands are exactly the last drawn frame's keeps the atlas as it stands
