/// Quality↔Efficiency slider, `QualityEfficiency.blurResolutionDivisor`) costs a quarter (or a
/// sixteenth) of the pixels and looks the same once the pass that reads them samples them
/// bilinearly. Only the effect's own FBOs shrink: its last pass still draws at the layer's size,
/// and every reduced buffer reports its authored size to the built-ins (`g_Texture0Texel`), so a
/// kernel's reach in UV space, and so the blur's radius, is unchanged.

///   whose sizes must match;
/// - chains on text or line-art layers, where a softened intermediate would show at sharp edges.
