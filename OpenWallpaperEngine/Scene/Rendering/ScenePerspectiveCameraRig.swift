/// (0x140183a70); docs/models-plan.md §2.1, §2.2:
///
/// 1. Every visible camera layer plays its paths; the last visible one is the camera, with its
///    (or its path's) fov (`SceneCameraLayers`).
/// 2. Without one: the `camera` block when the scene has no camera paths (or what
///    `thisScene.setCameraTransforms` set in its place), else the paths (`SceneCameraPaths`),
///    with the scene's `fov`.
/// 3. Camera shake moves the eye and the centre; the fov is clamped to 0.1…179.9.
/// 4. The view is `lookAtRH`; the projection is reversed-Z with `nearz`/`farz` and the target's
///    aspect. `zoom` does nothing here [I].
///
/// `camerafade` fades each scene camera path in and out whichever source is the camera, as WE
/// computes it from the paths' state alone (0x140180c1a).
