/// A puppet's texture channels (Puppet Warp › Texture Channels): WE's editor compiles them into
/// the rig's `.mdl` as a second mesh with flag 0x2 (`MDLMesh.isTextureChannelMesh`): a quad per
/// channel element in the base image's pixels (y up, from its bottom-left corner), drawn through
/// its own material (`puppettexturechannels`, `g_Texture0` the channels' atlas, `g_Texture1` the
/// base image) with `a_TexCoordVec4` = (atlas uv, base image uv) and `a_BlendIndices.x` the
/// channel's entry in `g_BlendMap`. The puppet json's `texturechannels` block is the editor's
/// source; the runtime reads only the `.mdl` (no "texturechannels" string in wallpaper64.exe).
///
/// WE draws it into the puppet's image-sized albedo target before the puppet's mesh samples it
/// (0x140207740): the target (the base texture's size) cleared, the image copied in by a quad
/// (`materials/util/fullscreenlayer.json`, puppet+0x410), then the channel mesh (puppet+0x408
/// material, +0x3f8 mesh) orthographic over the texture's pixels, blended over it, with
/// `g_BlendMap` = the first `BLENDROWCOUNT` rows of the channel weights (puppet+0x350,
/// 0x1402079c5). A rig with such a mesh takes that path (0x1402095de: puppet+0x390, the first
/// flag-0x2 mesh, ≥ 0); its own mesh then samples the target. WE 2.8.42's RenderDoc capture of
/// the rope shows the three draws: the copy, the channel quad (stride 44: position, blend
/// indices, `a_TexCoordVec4`; `g_BlendMap` 0, `g_Texture1Resolution` 96 512 96 512) and the
/// puppet sampling the target, which at the default weight 0 is the image exactly.
