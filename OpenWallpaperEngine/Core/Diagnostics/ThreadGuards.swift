/// Checks that heavy work stays off the main thread and the render thread, and that per-frame
/// work stays on the render thread. A check is a thread test; it never traps, in any build.
///
/// The render thread is whichever thread is inside `ThreadGuards.renderFrame { … }`: a scene
/// instance's `SceneRenderThread` runs its whole run loop inside it, and every frame entry wraps
/// itself in it too, so a renderer drawn by its view's own timer (tests, prewarm) still counts
/// the main thread as the render thread while it draws.
///
/// Every violation is recorded in `ThreadGuards.store` (thread, kind, what, call site, trimmed
/// call stack, time). What happens next depends on the build:
/// - **Tests:** the test bundle's observer fails the test that caused it, one issue per violation.
///   A test that expects violations collects them with `ThreadGuards.capture`, which keeps them
///   from failing it.
/// - **Dev builds** (DEBUG, or no release update key): also logged at error level, and counted
///   by `ThreadGuardMonitor`, which shows an indicator and lists them in Settings › Diagnostics.
/// - **Release:** only recorded.
