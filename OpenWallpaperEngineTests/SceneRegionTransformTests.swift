/// projection by `g_ModelViewProjectionMatrix`), whatever its parents, timeline, script or rotation
/// put it. The fixture draws a patterned scene and two composition layers with WE's pass-through
/// effect (`effects/_empty`): one in the scene's plane, the child of a turned, non-uniformly scaled
/// parent with an animated origin and its own rotation; one drawn through the perspective camera
/// (`perspective`), the child of a turned parent, with an animated origin and a tilt. Drawn back
/// where they are, both must leave the frame as it is without them: a region cropped anywhere else
/// (the local position, the authored origin, the unrotated box, an affine stand-in for the
/// perspective) shows another part of the scene over the whole quad.
